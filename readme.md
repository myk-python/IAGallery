# IAGallery<br>
###A collection of pages to create a Flask-based single-page application for image viewing.

To use the contents of these pages natively, create a parent directory with whatever name you choose.<br>
Save "IAGallery.py" in this folder.<br>
Create "static" and "templates" folders in the same location.<br>
Add "img_visibility.js", "styles.css" and a chosen icon to the "static" folder.<br>
Add "index_SPA.html" to the "templates" folder.<br>
<br>
<br>
The site is built to read from images in the "static" folder - it is coded for four images.<br>
This can be changed easily but needs to be completed in all files except CSS<br>
(see individual comments for clarity).
